# Publications

The development of _EvoMaster_ is rooted in academia.
Here, you can find the PDFs of all the academic publications based on _EvoMaster_. 
Furthermore, slides of presentations can be  found [here](presentations.md).
These can be useful if you want to know more on how _EvoMaster_ works internally,
e.g., details on the Many Independent Objective (MIO) algorithm.
